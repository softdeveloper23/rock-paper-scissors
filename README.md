#### Description:
A Rock, Paper, Scissors project Python-based game where the player competes against the computer in the classic hand game. The player and the computer both choose one of the three moves: rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the standard rules:
-Rock beats scissors
-Scissors beat paper
-Paper beats rock
The game allows the player to choose their name and the difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). The computer's move is generated based on the chosen difficulty level and the player's move history. The game also features a typewriter effect for displaying text and uses text-to-speech for the computer's introduction.
The game keeps track of the scores and displays taunts based on the outcome of each round. The taunts vary depending on the score difference between the player and the computer. The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches a predefined maximum number of points.
The project includes several functions, such as get_name(), validate_name(), get_difficulty(), and generate_random_move(), which handle various aspects of the game, such as getting the player's name, validating the name, selecting the difficulty level, and generating the computer's move based on the difficulty level and user move history.
Unit tests have been written for some of the functions to ensure their correctness and reliability. The project demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts, such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and error handling, as well as external libraries like unittest.mock and pytest for testing purposes.
